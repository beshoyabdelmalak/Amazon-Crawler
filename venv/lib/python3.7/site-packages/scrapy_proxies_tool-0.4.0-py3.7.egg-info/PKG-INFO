Description: Random proxy middleware for Scrapy (http://scrapy.org/)
        =======================================================
        
        **base on https://github.com/aivarsk/scrapy-proxies , support  load proxies from https://github.com/qiyeboy/IPProxyPool**
        
        Processes Scrapy requests using a random proxy from list to avoid IP ban and
        improve crawling speed.
        
        Get your proxy list from sites like http://www.hidemyass.com/ (copy-paste into text file
        and reformat to http://host:port format)
        
        Install
        --------
        
        The quick way:
        
        ```bash
        pip install scrapy-proxies-tool
        ```
        
        Or checkout the source and run
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        settings.py
        -----------
        
        ```python
        
        # Retry many times since proxies often fail
        RETRY_TIMES = 10
        # Retry on most error codes since proxies fail for different reasons
        RETRY_HTTP_CODES = [500, 503, 504, 400, 403, 404, 408]
        
        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
          'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry.RetryMiddleware': 90,
          'scrapy_proxies.RandomProxy': 100,
          'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware': 110,
        }
        
        PROXY_SETTINGS = {
          # Proxy list containing entries like
          # http://host1:port
          # http://username:password@host2:port
          # http://host3:port
          # ...
          # if PROXY_SETTINGS[from_proxies_server] = True , proxy_list is server address (ref https://github.com/qiyeboy/IPProxyPool and https://github.com/awolfly9/IPProxyTool )
          # Only support http(ref https://github.com/qiyeboy/IPProxyPool#%E5%8F%82%E6%95%B0)
          # list : ['http://localhost:8000?protocol=0'],
          'list':['/path/to/proxy/list.txt'],
        
          # disable proxy settings and  use real ip when all proxies are unusable
          'use_real_when_empty':False,
          'from_proxies_server':False,
        
          # If proxy mode is 2 uncomment this sentence :
          # 'custom_proxy': "http://host1:port",
        
          # Proxy mode
          # 0 = Every requests have different proxy
          # 1 = Take only one proxy from the list and assign it to every requests
          # 2 = Put a custom proxy to use in the settings
          'mode':0
        }
        ```
        
        For older versions of Scrapy (before 1.0.0) you have to use
        `scrapy.contrib.downloadermiddleware.retry.RetryMiddleware` and
        `scrapy.contrib.downloadermiddleware.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware`
        middlewares instead.
        
        
        Your spider
        -----------
        
        In each callback ensure that proxy /really/ returned your target page by
        checking for site logo or some other significant element.
        If not - retry request with dont_filter=True
        
        ```python
          if not hxs.select('//get/site/logo'):
            yield Request(url=response.url, dont_filter=True)
        ```
